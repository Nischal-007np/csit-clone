            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p> <strong>CSIT Association of BMC</strong> is a non-profitable organization inside Butwal Multiple Campus created for the welfare of CSIT Students by the CSIT students and operating actively since 2016.</p>
            <p>
                We have been conducting several tech and non-tech workshops internally and helping students to connect with national tech community. Similarly, we also play a part in assisting our college department for technical assistance and provide suggestions based on technology criteria.</p>
                <p>
                    We believe that the students should be provided with the relevant skills and platform to prepare them for their career and at last we are at Butwal Multiple Campus with the motive of helping students to address their problem as well.
